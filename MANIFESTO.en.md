EvoCodeJS Manifesto
By 2025, it became evident that the traditional approaches to programming and software development, refined over decades, were hopelessly outdated.

In the past, we built powerful and cumbersome frameworks to reduce the amount of code developers needed to write to implement applications and to minimize the necessity of mastering numerous disparate technologies. However, by hiding the complexity of systems, we increasingly moved away from basic and efficient tools, resulting in even greater complexity.

Today, thanks to AI, the paradigm of programming and system creation is shifting.

We can now generate the required code using the most efficient and straightforward tools for web application development, without relying on massive frameworks composed of dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of interconnected libraries.

Routine tasks, such as writing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, or React code, no longer consume the majority of a developer's time.

Instead, we can create a new type of frameworkâ€”one that is not focused on overcoming technical limitations but based on concepts, behavioral rules within the project, and AI-driven suggestions about how our applications should be organized and constructed.

By adhering to these rules, suggestions, and expectations, we can allow AI to implement our original ideas, enabling us to focus on the value of the product rather than on writing trivial code and solving routine tasks.
